* package objects

### Imports

* imports from objects and vals
* multi imports
* import aliases
* wildcard imports with exclusions

### Objects and classes
* constructors - primary, auxiliary
* generics
* vals, lazy vals, vars, bean properties
* methods, full syntax
* abstract members
* no statics, companion objects
